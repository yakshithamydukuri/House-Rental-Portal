House Rental Portal

House Rental Portal: Web3 Ethereum leasing and IoT monitoring for Peltier nodes with automated rent and DHT11, gas, and voltage sensor diagnostics.

🏠 Project Overview

The House Rental Portal is a sophisticated command-center interface providing complete transparency and decentralized control over smart architectural nodes. By leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, the system automates the entire rental lifecycle—from security deposit locking and initial booking to recurring monthly rent broadcasts and lease termination.

This portal acts as the digital head-end for IoT-enabled assets, bridging the gap between blockchain-based financial agreements and physical hardware monitoring.

🚀 Key Features

Web3 Identity Protocol: Secure MetaMask integration that validates users as Guest, Tenant, or Landlord to provide role-based access to specific control sectors.

Architectural Visualization: A dynamic monitoring node that updates its visual state (colors and neon glow) in real-time based on blockchain occupancy data.

Intelligent Portal Logic:

Automated Booking: Transmits the required collateral and first cycle's rent in a single atomic transaction.

Tenant Portal: An emerald-glowing interface that unlocks exclusively for the verified leaseholder to broadcast monthly rent payments.

Administrative Suite: Specialized tools for the Landlord to manage agreements and reset node status.

Global Monitoring Aura: A high-intensity neon glow system across all sectors to signal live network synchronization and hardware health.

🛠️ Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS (Responsive 3-column layout)

Blockchain: Ethers.js (v5.7) for real-time contract synchronization.

Icons: FontAwesome 6.4 Professional set.

Design: Decent architectural palette featuring Muted Slate, Off-White, and Mahogany accents.

🔌 Hardware Integration (IoT Node)

The system is designed to monitor and control a Smart Refrigerator Node equipped with the following hardware suite:

Thermodynamics: Peltier cooling kit, integrated cooling kit, and a high-performance cooling fan system.

Environmental Sensors: * DHT11: Real-time temperature and humidity tracking.

Gas Sensor: Internal atmosphere and safety monitoring.

Power Management: Specialized voltage sensors and a dedicated separate voltage supply for the fan system.

Access Control: RFID and IR sensor integration for physical door locking, synchronized with the blockchain "CLOSED" state.

📦 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/House-Rental-Portal.git](https://github.com/your-username/House-Rental-Portal.git)


Launch the Dashboard:
Open index.html in a Web3-supported browser (Brave, or Chrome with the MetaMask extension).

Sync Identity:
Click "Establish Connection" in the header to link your wallet. The portal will automatically detect your role and unlock the appropriate sectors.
